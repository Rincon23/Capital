/**
 * The aporte: how much of an amount goes to each type and each asset. Pure — the screen calls it
 * on every change and the tests call it with the owner's spreadsheet.
 *
 * - `V` is what is invested now (the types in the portfolio), `A` the aporte, `T = V + A`.
 * - An asset weighs `max(0, score)`, or 0 with "Não compro mais" (never bought).
 * - A type's target in R$ is `target × T`. The assets marked "Não compro mais" still fill it:
 *   only what is left (target − their value, never below 0) is split among the assets that
 *   receive, by weight. A fixed-income total is the only asset of its type and gets all of it.
 * - A type never receives more than it lacks for its own target, whatever its assets lack: with
 *   the "Não compro mais" ones above it, nobody in that type is bought until it is back below.
 * - A type with a target but nobody who can receive hands its target to the other types, in
 *   proportion to their targets (and the screen says so).
 * - `A` goes first to whoever is furthest below their target, levelling them (what the owner did
 *   by hand with the spreadsheet's "prioridade"), then is rounded down to whole quotas; what is
 *   left buys one quota at a time of the asset with the biggest gap whose price still fits, and
 *   the fractional assets and fixed income take the cents. Never sells, never spends more than
 *   `A`, never buys an asset that weighs 0.
